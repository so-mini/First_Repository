                        <p>Hello there, and welcome to Mini Recipes! My name is Lily, and as if it weren't obvious enough, I love baking and baked goodies. <br>I can't even remember since when, but I remember always wanting to learn how to bake.However, growing up in an Asian household (and you'll most probably also relate if you're Asian yourself!), the oven in our house was always just an additional storage cupboard for pots, pans, and every other random thing that is used frequently in a kitchen! Now this is a problem, because you can't really bake most things unless you have an available oven to bake your goodies in. <br> Fast forward to almost twenty years later, my family and I finally moved to a house where I made it a point to let my mother know to stop storing ALL our pots and pans in the oven because, lo-and-behold, I would use the oven to bake! And this is how my short, but quite significant baking journey began. I did an extensive amount of googling, trying different recipes and getting a hang of basic baking principles, and I learned to love not only the process, but also the yummy results that accompany the journey.<br>Funnily enough, I'm not a fan of super sweet things, so all the recipes in this website have sugar amounts that can be adjusted to your liking! My base recipes usually stir on the less-sweet-side of things, but feel free to add a little more if you have a sweeter tooth than I do!</p>
